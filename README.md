## COMPILE AND TEST

using rake (with cmake and ninja)

```
rake
```

to compile using mingw open MSYS2 shell and compile as in unix evironment.
The commanda run `cmake` with the appropriate parameters.

### Compile without the use of rake

Prepare for compilation

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

compile with ninja (reccomended)

```
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
```

or use default (makfile in unix)

```
cmake ..
make # or make -j10 for parallel copilation
```

other engines are avaible in windows or unix.
